# DAQNoiseRates
This C++ script will generate a file called DAQ.ratdb for use in RATPAC for the AIT-WATCHMAN project. The DAQ.ratdb file will contain the default options currently on the ait-watchman GitHub, and add an average PMT noise rate, and populate an array for the individual noise rate of the 3558 PMT's. The current version will use the nominal noise rate of 3 kHz for both the average and individual rates. Later versions will populate the array with randomly generated noise rates up to the maximum of 10 kHz. All noise rates use double precision floating point numbers as the variable type.
